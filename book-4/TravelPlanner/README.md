# Travel Planner

* A travel agent can log into the app.
* A travel agent can create clients. When they log in, they should see a list of only their clients.
* Clients should have a first name, last name, and phone number.
* A travel agent can create a trip for a client. The trip should have a start date, end date, and location.
* When a travel agent clicks on a client's details, they should see all trips assigned to that client.
* When a travel agent clicks on a "Trips" link in the nav bar, they should see all trips that any of their clients have created.
* Trips should be sorted by date
* Trips that have already happened should not appear on the trip index view by default. Instead, travel agents should see a button that says "view past trips". When they click a button, they should only see trips that have already happened.
* Travel agents should be able to search trips by location from the trips index view.
* Travel agents should be able to search clients by first and last name.
